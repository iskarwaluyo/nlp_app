## NLPApp

The Natural Language Processing App (NLPApp) is designed to help easily analyze large quantities of text. The user can select the language of the data source and data source. The data source and languages will depend on the source of the data the user or client needs to analyze. 

   knitr::include_graphics('/media/iskar/archivos/R/DATA_SCIENCE_CAPSTONE/nlp_app/images/nlp.jpg')


## NLPApp functionalities

The user can select the language and data source that needs to be analyzed. 
In this demo app we have implemented the following functionalities: 

1. View a sample of the text that is to be analyzed.
2. Plot the most common unigrams, bigrams and trigrams. 
3. Text search - Allows user to search occurences of phrases.
4. Text prediction - Allows user to view the most probable next word given a certain phrase.

For more information about unigrams, bigrams and trigrams click [here]. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram).

```{r eruptions}
inputPanel(
  selectInput("n_breaks", label = "Number of bins:",
              choices = c(10, 20, 35, 50), selected = 20),
  
  sliderInput("bw_adjust", label = "Bandwidth adjustment:",
              min = 0.2, max = 2, value = 1, step = 0.2)
)

renderPlot({
  hist(faithful$eruptions, probability = TRUE, breaks = as.numeric(input$n_breaks),
       xlab = "Duration (minutes)", main = "Geyser eruption duration")
  
  dens <- density(faithful$eruptions, adjust = input$bw_adjust)
  lines(dens, col = "blue")
})
```

## Bullets

- Bullet 1
- Bullet 2
- Bullet 3

## R Output

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
